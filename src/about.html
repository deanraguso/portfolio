                    NEOC is a full-time training course to induct newly commissioned officers into the Royal
                    Australian Navy. It puts a heavy emphasis on teamwork and strong leadership, as well as 
                    a component of physical training, which peaks during the initial training period. 
                    <br/>
                    I left NEOC feeling physically healthy, and confident in my ability to lead a team.

                    Leage of Legends is a game I've been playing casually since grade 9 in high school.    
                    It is a competetive multiplayer online strategy game, which also involves some skill
                    based mechanics. Although I don't play as frequently as I used to, it is my favourite
                    game to date.

                <p>
                    Before I joined the navy, I was scared of swimming at the beach. While in Sydney though,
                    I swam almost daily, and learned to love being in the water. Now, I go more than 
                    once per week to Williamstown beach for a dip. I love strapping on some goggles, and 
                    diving deep below the surface to observe interesting fish, stingrays and formations.

                <p>
                    In 2020, I fulfilled my childhood dream of owning a motorcycle. I have since ridden
                    tens of thousands of kilometers. I love going to different beaches mainly, but I endeavor 
                    to explore every state that I live in fully, on two wheels.

                <p>
                    I was not a fan of reading in school, the material they gave us was always
                    boring to me. When I was attending University however, I discovered 
                    self-development, and fell in love with reading books on improvement, the ability to learn and become a more
                    intellegent and knowledgable human being. Today, I read all the time, about 
                    anything relevant to me, philosophy, dating, coding, investing, etc.
